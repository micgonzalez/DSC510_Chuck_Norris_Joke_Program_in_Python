# DSC510 Chuck Norris Joke Program in Python

# Abstract
I was tasked to create a python program that makes a GET request of a API that connects to Chuck Norris Jokes. This python program will receive a JSON response which includes various pieces of data. The program allows the user to request a Chuck Norris joke as many times as they would like. Below are a few guidelines for this program:

If you ask the user to enter “Y” and they enter y, is that ok? Does it fail? If it fails, display a message for the user. There are other ways to handle this. 
Think about included string functions you might be able to call.
Your program must include a header as in previous weeks.
Your program must include a welcome message for the user.

This is a preview image of the code used for this joke program. If you want to try it? You can find it in this repository.

# Findings
I was amazed by the straightforward process of connecting to a API. This python program was a fun project that made the idea of creating a program less intimidating.

# Challenges
This being a more involved program, I have a hard time developing a program that fellowed the guidelines mentioned above. I had no problem connecting to the API, my issue was creating a clear way to exit the program. I also had a hard time to develop a way for the user to enter the program after exiting it. These were a few challages that I had overcomed.

# Conclusion
This was great project to learn about the great uses of the python programming language. This project also showed me the benefits of connecting to APIs and how you can develop great appilcations with them.
